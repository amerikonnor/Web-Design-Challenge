This project entailed designing a responsive bootstrap style webpage that displays results of weather analysis.

The data is from a previous project where 500 random cities were selected and weather data was pulled from the OpenWeather API.
Four different compenents of the weather (humidity, temperature, cloudiness, and wind speed) were then graphed against latitude to find any correlations.

The home page has a summary of the project, as well as links to each of the individual comparison graphs. There is a data page that displays all the data used in an html table.
The graphs are shown all together on the comparisons page, as well as individually on their own visualization pages, where each has a short description of findings.
